Pssst, hey you! Do you want to apply some control theory?

## About this project
This project aims to provide detailed instructions for building your own inverted pendulum hardware setup and stabilizing it using either one of the sample controllers or letting you apply your own control logic to it.
### Cool story bro, but what's an inverted pendulum?
An inverted pendulum is a classic control theory problem where the goal is to balance a pendulum upright akin to balancing a broom on your hand. There are multiple possible ways to do that, like moving the pivot holding the pendulum arm in a linear or rotational axis - kind of like moving your hand to keep the broom from falling -, using flywheels,  different kinds of oscillating motion, and probably more. This project aims to build an inverted pendulum on a cart moving along a linear axis. 

Right now, this is still a bit of a work in progress, so check back in a bit to see how you can build your own system.
In the meantime, feel free to check out [this lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3bblng-Kcc) on the topic!
